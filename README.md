# Custom Framework Replacer
A Magisk module wthich allow you to replace your original framework.jar. Can be used to spoof app signatures which is useful to let microG work.

## How to use
Just put your patched framework.jar (You can use [Tingle](https://github.com/ale5000-git/tingle) to patch it) in `/path/to/module/system/framework` and zip the whole folder. Then flash the zip you get via Magisk Manager or Recovery. After a reboot, check the `microG Settings` to make sure the patch works.

Just open a issue if you have any problem when using this module.(Though I think there won't be many problems!)
